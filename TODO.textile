h2. Deploy an initial version to GAE 

Still only running on my PC...

h2. Optimize queries

I don't really know which queries are run in each scenario, which might result in performance problems.

h2. Get rid of Siena

(a) not helping, (b) seems like a dead project

h2. Complete data flow:

When a new Sale is added, create New MemberSaleDetails for each member. Relevant information: debt
When a member edits her order, update MemberSaleDetails. Relevant information: ordered, orderPrice, etc.
On sale day, relevant information to be edited: orderTaken, payment, comment

Problems: what happens when a price is modified? (will not affect orderPrice, unless calculated every time)
